## Lesson Objectives

- Understand how generative AI fits with other AI techniques
- How to create vector embeddings and test for similarity
- Understand the transformer architecture and how it works at a high level
- Setup and use Colab Pro for experimenting with vector embeddings and downloading/testing a GPT-2 model.
- Start becoming familiar with the basics of notebooks and Python (if you haven’t used it already)

# A recap of ML/Neural Network architectures

# Vector Embeddings

## What are Vector Embeddings?

- Vector Embeddings are **meaningful numerical representations** of words
  - Representations where strings of words (i.e., sentences) are encoded into multi-dimensional space
  - Similar sentences have similar numbers

## Example

```python
model.encode("The cat sat on the mat")
```

```
array([ 1.30401835e-01, -1.18701281e-02, 
       -2.81170383e-02,  5.12386411e-02,
       -5.59744686e-02,  3.01915426e-02, 
        3.01612969e-02,  2.46983729e-02,
       ...
])
```

## Example

```python
model.encode("The dog rested on the rug")
```

```
array([ 1.22975238e-01,  4.51563150e-02, 
        3.61849144e-02,  9.36113819e-02,
       -2.68524364e-02,  6.86257482e-02,
       -1.26129715e-03,  2.68533616e-03,
       ...
])
```

## Example

```python
model.encode("I love pizza!")
```

```
array([-9.43841636e-02,  2.38583814e-02, 
        9.20313317e-03,  4.99277934e-02,
