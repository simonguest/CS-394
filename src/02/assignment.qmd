**Objective:** Build a chat interface (in a separate Colab notebook) that helps a user complete tasks.

**Requirements:**

- Gradio chat interface with streaming responses
- System prompt that defines the AI as a travel planning expert (or pick your own scenario, if you have a better idea!)
- Implements a well-thought out system prompt (with feedback on the rationale behind it).
- Demonstrates at least 2 different models via OpenRouter as a dropdown in Gradio. (Not necessarily at the same time.)
  - Try to pick a large (foundational model) and a much smaller open source instruct model to compare the differences.
- Use structured outputs when returning results to the user (e.g., a downloadable itinerary that the user can download)
  - Example schema: Trip with fields like destination, duration_days, activities (list), budget_level, daily_schedule (list of day objects)

**Deliverable: A Colab/Jupyter notebook with:**

- Code cells with your implementation
- Uses OPENROUTER_API_KEY for the API token. (Please do not include your API key in your notebook!)
- Markdown cells explaining what the notebook does and any observations
