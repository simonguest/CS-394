## Integration of AI Models (10%)

| 2% | 4% | 6% | 8% | 10% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Only one AI model integrated with minimal effort or inappropriate model choice. Integration is superficial with no optimization. | Two AI models present but poorly integrated or not well-suited to their tasks. Limited optimization effort shown. | Two appropriate AI models integrated with basic functionality. Some optimization attempted but significant improvements possible. | Two well-chosen AI models effectively integrated and optimized for their respective tasks. Clear rationale for model selection. | Excellent integration of multiple AI techniques with sophisticated optimization. Models are perfectly suited to tasks with exceptional implementation. |

## Functionality (10%)

| 2% | 4% | 6% | 8% | 10% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project is largely non-functional with AI components not working. Major bugs and errors prevent basic usage. | Project runs but AI components frequently fail or produce incorrect results. Significant functionality issues present. | Project is functional with AI components working in most cases. Some bugs or limitations affect user experience. | Project is fully working with AI components functioning reliably as intended. Minor issues may exist but don't impact core functionality. | Project is fully functional with flawless AI integration. All components work seamlessly together with robust error handling. |

## Innovation and Creativity (10%)

| 2% | 4% | 6% | 8% | 10% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Generic AI usage with no creative application. Design is basic with poor aesthetics and no meaningful AI enhancement. | AI used in conventional ways with limited creativity. Design shows some effort but AI doesn't meaningfully enhance the experience. | Creative AI application with interesting use cases. Design is competent with AI providing noticeable visual or interactive improvements. | Innovative AI usage providing unique and compelling experiences. Strong aesthetic and functional design that effectively leverages AI capabilities. | Exceptional creativity with groundbreaking AI applications. Outstanding design that seamlessly integrates AI to create truly unique and compelling experiences. |

## Ethical Analysis (10%)

| 2% | 4% | 6% | 8% | 10% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| No ethical analysis provided or only superficial acknowledgment of issues. No consideration of biases or societal impacts. | Limited ethical analysis with minimal identification of potential issues. Brief mention of biases but no mitigation strategies proposed. | Adequate evaluation of biases and ethical implications with some discussion of societal impacts. Basic mitigation proposals included. | Thorough evaluation of potential biases, ethical implications, and societal impacts. Clear and practical proposals for mitigating identified risks. | Comprehensive and insightful ethical analysis demonstrating deep understanding of AI implications. Sophisticated mitigation strategies with consideration of broader societal impacts. |

## Presentation (20%)

| 4% | 8% | 12% | 16% | 20% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Presentation is unclear and disorganized with minimal explanation of AI features. If in a team, roles were undefined and collaboration issues evident. | Presentation covers basic points but lacks engagement or clear explanation of AI integration process. If in a team, some team member contributions unclear. | Clear presentation highlighting main AI features and challenges faced. If in a team, collaboration is adequate with most roles and contributions identifiable. | Clear and engaging presentation effectively showcasing AI features and their purpose. Comprehensive explanation of integration process including model selection and solutions, with well-defined team roles (if applicable). | Outstanding presentation that captivates audience while thoroughly explaining AI implementation. Exceptional teamwork (if applicable) with seamless collaboration and clearly articulated individual contributions. |
