Then it prints the list of all keywords that Python recognizes, so you can see exactly which words are reserved and cannot be used as variable names or function names.\n\nThink of the keyword list like a list of stop signs at an intersection: each stop sign tells drivers (or in this case, the Python interpreter) that they must stop and follow a specific rule. Just as you can't drive through a stop sign, you can't use these words as your own identifiers\u2014they're reserved for special meanings in the language."}]}
