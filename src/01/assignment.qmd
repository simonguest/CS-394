# Week 1 Assignment - "Build Your Own Text Continuation Style"

**Objective:** Create a Colab notebook that uses GPT-2 to generate creative text continuations with different "personalities" or styles.

**Requirements:**

- Load a pre-trained GPT-2 model (using HuggingFace transformers - same to what was demonstrated in GPT-2.ipynb)
- Create 3 different prompt templates that guide the model toward different styles (e.g., "Write like a pirate:", "Explain like I'm 5:", "As a news reporter:")
- For each template, generate text using two different sampling strategies (e.g., greedy vs. temperature sampling)
- Compare and document the outputs (using Markdown in the notebook) - what differences do you notice?
- **Creative component:** Design your own custom prompt that produces interesting or useful outputs

**Deliverable: A Colab/Jupyter notebook with:**

- Code cells with your implementation
- Outputs of generated text from GPT-2
- Markdown cells explaining what each sampling strategy does and any observations

**Hint:**

Remember GPT-2 is a completion model (not instruction tuned), so you'll need to create a template that provides examples:

```{python}
prompt_template = """Rewrite sentences as a pirate would say them:

Normal: I'm going to the market.
Pirate: Arrr, I be sailin' to the marketplace, matey!

Normal: That's a beautiful ship.
Pirate: Shiver me timbers, that be a fine vessel!

Normal: {user_input}
Pirate:"""

# Example usage:
user_input = "Can you help me find my keys?"
prompt = prompt_template.format(user_input=user_input)
```
