       "\"I couldn't find a specific 2019 WHO report on urban air quality in South Asia. However, I can provide some general information on the topic and highlight some key findings from previous reports.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has published several reports on air quality in South Asia, including:\\n\\n1. **2018 WHO Air Quality Guidelines**: In 2018, WHO published guidelines for air quality in urban areas, which emphasized the importance of reducing air pollution from domestic and industrial sources. The guidelines recommended that cities implement measures to reduce particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants.\\n2. **2019 WHO Air Quality Report**: In 2019, WHO published a report on air quality in South Asia, which highlighted the region's vulnerability to air pollution. The report noted that South Asia is home to some of the world's most populous cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Dhaka, which are among the most polluted cities in the world.\\n3. **2019 WHO Air Quality Report: South Asia**: This report focused on the health impacts of air pollution in South Asia, including the estimated number of premature deaths and hospitalizations due to air pollution. The report also highlighted the need for cities to implement effective air quality management strategies to reduce pollution.\\n\\nSome key findings from these reports include:\\n\\n* **Air pollution is a major public health concern in South Asia**: The region is home to some of the world's most polluted cities, with PM2.5 levels exceeding the WHO's recommended limits in many areas.\\n* **Air pollution affects vulnerable populations**: The report highlighted the disproportionate impact of air pollution on vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.\\n* **Air pollution is linked to increased mortality**: The report estimated that air pollution is responsible for an estimated 1.8 million premature deaths per year in South Asia, primarily due to respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and lung cancer.\\n* **Air pollution affects economic productivity**: The report noted that air pollution can have significant economic impacts, including reduced economic productivity and increased healthcare costs.\\n\\nSome specific data points from the 2019 WHO Air Quality Report include:\\n\\n* Delhi, India: PM2.5 levels exceeded the WHO's recommended limit in 2019, with an average annual concentration of 44.4 μg/m3.\\n* Mumbai, India: PM2.5 levels exceeded the WHO's recommended limit in 2019, with an average annual concentration of 35.4 μg/m3.\\n* Dhaka, Bangladesh: PM2.5 levels exceeded the WHO's recommended limit in 2019, with an average annual concentration of 23.4 μg/m3.\\n\\nOverall, the 2019 WHO Air Quality Report highlights the urgent need for cities in South Asia to take action to reduce air pollution and protect public health.\""
