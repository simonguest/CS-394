**Objective:** Extend the DigiPen Campus Agent by adding a new specialized agent that handles a specific domain.

**Background:**

The Campus Agent currently has four specialized agents: Building Agent, Course Agent, Handbook Agent, and Cafe Agent. Your task is to add a fifth agent that serves a new purpose on campus.

**Suggested Agent Ideas (pick one, or propose your own):**

- **Events Agent** - Helps students find information about campus events, club meetings, and activities
- **IT Agent** - Assists with common IT issues, lab software, and printing
- **Library Agent** - Helps students find resources, reserve study rooms, or check hours
- **Career Services Agent** - Provides information about internships, resume reviews, and career fairs
- **Transportation Agent** - Helps with parking, shuttle schedules, and commute options

**Requirements:**

1. **Create a new agent** with appropriate instructions (system prompt)
2. **Implement knowledge retrieval** using one of these approaches:
   - Add documents to the vector store and use `FileSearchTool`, OR
   - Create a custom tool using `@function_tool` that returns relevant data OR
   - Create a new (or select an existing) MCP server
3. **Integrate with the main Campus Agent** via handoff
4. **Test your agent** with at least 3 different queries and document the results
5. **Use the OpenAI Traces Dashboard** to debug at least one interaction and include a screenshot or description of what you observed

**Deliverable: A Colab/Jupyter notebook with:**

- Code cells with your implementation (building on the campus-agent.ipynb starter)
- Uses OPENAI_API_KEY for the API token. (Please do not include your API key in your notebook!)
- Markdown cells explaining:
  - What agent you chose and why
  - How you implemented knowledge retrieval (vector store vs. custom tool)
  - Your test queries and the agent's responses
  - What you learned from the Traces Dashboard (what worked, what didn't, any debugging insights)

**Bonus:**

Deploy your extended Campus Agent to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces){.external target="_blank"} and include the URL in your submission. Remember to add your OPENAI_API_KEY as a secret in your Space settings (not in the code!).

**Hints:**

- Start by copying the campus-agent.ipynb notebook and modifying it
- Keep your agent's scope focused - a narrower domain with good data works better than a broad domain with sparse data
- If using the vector store, you can upload files via the [OpenAI Platform Storage](https://platform.openai.com/storage){.external target="_blank"}
- If using a custom tool, remember that the function's docstring helps the LLM understand when to call it
