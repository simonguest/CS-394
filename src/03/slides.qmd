## Recap

- Understood the evolution and licensing of models from GPT-2 through to modern day
- Understood instruction-tuned models, how they work, and how to configure
- Setup and used OpenRouter for accessing hosted models
- Understood the OpenAI API specification, the request/response payload, parameters, streaming, and structured output
- Created and shared a chatbot using a Gradio-based UI

## Lesson Objectives

- Describe the fundamental concepts behind Agents/Agentic AI
- Explore and provide feedback on an existing multi-agent setup
- Understand available agent SDKs, how they differ, and advantages/disadvantages
- Use the OpenAI Agents SDK to build an multi-agent system from scratch, including document indexing and retrieval
- Understand and implement tool calls and implement using OpenAI’s function calling and via MCP

# Why Agents?

## Why Agents?

- Limitations of our prior chatbots
  - Needs constant human input every turn; No ability to plan beyond a single interaction
  - Single model with single context (conversation)
  - No ability to interact with external systems

## What is an Agent?

Imagine a __DigiPen Campus Assistant__: An AI agent that can help you navigate anything and everything at DigiPen!

- "Where can I find the 'Hopper' room?"
- "Can you tell me more about FLM201?"
- "Oh, and what's today's vegetarian option at the Bytes Cafe?"

## Five Characteristics of Agents

1. Agents are **Planners**

- Agents are driven by goals
- And they can put together a plan for the steps to complete that goal.
  - "First, I will discover where course information is located"
  - "Then I will search for any courses that reference FLM201"
  - "Then I summarize all of the key points for the student"

## Five Characteristics of Agents

2. Agents are **Autonomous**

- Agents can then go off and execute the plan, independent of human input
- The concept of "human in the loop" still applies for confirmation
  - e.g. "Do you really want to place this order at the Bytes Cafe?"

## Five Characteristics of Agents

3. Agents are **Reactive**

- Agents can change mid-course depending on what they find and/or the environment.
  - e.g. "I couldn't find any course information on FLM201. I'm going to check if there are other 200-level FLM courses before responding to the student."

## Five Characteristics of Agents

4. Agents have **Persistence**

- Agents often have memory systems beyond the current conversation
- Broadly classified as short and long term memory 
  - Short term memory could be the options at the Bytes Cafe
  - Long term memory could be your food preferences

## Five Characteristics of Agents

5. Agents can **Interact** with external systems

- Agents can **delegate** to other agents for complex tasks
  - (Or for tasks where other agents are better suited for.)
  - e.g., Campus Agent -> delegating to a Course Agent
- Agents can also be given access to external **tools**
  - e.g., File search, Web search, access to the Bytes Cafe API

# Hands-On

Try the DigiPen Campus Agent!

[**https://simonguest-campus-agent.hf.space/**](https://simonguest-campus-agent.hf.space/){.external target="_blank"}

Q: What worked? What surprised you?

Q: What didn't work? Where did the agent fail?

# OpenAI Agents SDK

## OpenAI Agents SDK

- [Announced](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/){.external target="_blank"} in Mar 2025
  - Together with web search, file search, and computer use
  - And a new Responses API (formerly Assistants API)

## OpenAI Agents SDK

- Created to address the gap between chat completions (what we were using last week) and multi-step systems
  - vs. building your own, which a lot of developers were doing at the time
- Integrates function calling, handoffs, and statement management in the same package
- Supports Python and TypeScript; MIT licensed

## Not the only Agent SDK in town!

![Source: https://e2b.dev](./images/ai-agents-landscape.png)

## LangGraph 
- https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/
- Python only
- MIT License
- One of the first agent frameworks, building on LangChain
  - IMO, too abstract/complex/bloated

## Crew.ai

- https://github.com/crewaiinc/crewai
- Python only
- One of the more popular commercial offerings
  - (Although they do have an MIT License/freemium model)

## Microsoft 

- AutoGen
  - https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/
  - Python (.NET coming soon)
  - MIT License
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel
  - https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel
  - Python, .NET, Java
  - MIT License

## Microsoft

- Now converging into the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework){.external target="_blank"}
- (One of the few agent SDKs to support .NET)

## What's a Vector Store?

- A way to provide domain-specific knowledge beyond training data
  - e.g., current semester course information that is newer than GPT-5.2's cutoff date
- We could just insert these into the context window
  - But doesn't scale to more than a few documents

## What's a Vector Store?

- Instead, we use a vector store
  - Converts documents, paragraphs, or sentences into vector embeddings
  - (Remember these from module 1? :)
- Similar concepts are close to each other in vector space
  - Which makes it efficient to query
- Queries return the document (or pages within a document) that match
  - e.g., "Michelangelo" returns "Page 1 of the floor map"

## What's a Vector Store?

- Foundation for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
  - (Which we will cover in module 6)
- Many different types of vectors stores/databases
- For now, we will be using the OpenAI built in one

## Agent Structure

![Agents and tools for the DigiPen Campus Agent](./images/agent_graph.png)

## Why Do Agents Need Tools?

- The scope of the agents ability is contained within the model
- Tools enable the agent to reach out to systems beyond the model
- Examples
  - Read a file from disk or search the web (built in)
  - Calculator (because LLMs aren't great at math)
  - Code interpreter (running code on the fly)

## OpenAI Tool Calling

- Introduced by OpenAI in June 2023
- Originally called Function Calling
- Models are fine-tuned to return a structured function_call JSON object, specifying which function to call and with what arguments.
- Tools are provided as functions
- Option for the LLM to decide when to call the tool (always, never, auto)

# Let's Run the Campus Agent

## Let's Run the Campus Agent

- Does the OpenAI Agents SDK work with OpenRouter?
  - Yes and No :)
- Yes to core functionality
  - Creating an agent, handoffs, calling custom tools
- No to calling built-in OpenAI tools
  - File search, Web search, Code interpreter 

## Let's Run the Campus Agent

- We'll need to create an OpenAI developer account
- Potentially add some credits to it

# Hands-On

Create a new developer account at [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com){.external target="_blank"}

Create a new API key at [https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys){.external target="_blank"}

# Hands-On

Get the Campus Agent Notebook up and running (campus-agent.ipynb)

# Hands-On

Pick your own scenario and create your own agents from scratch.

# Multiple Agents


# Patterns

## Memory

- HANDS ON

# Beyond Function Tooling

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- OpenAI's tool/function calling works if you have local access to the tools
- But how about external systems?
  - e.g., Access to calendar, other systems, hardware, etc.
- You could build local tools to call APIs
- MCP: Model Context Protocol
- Standardized tooling interface, released by Anthropic in March 2024

## MCP

- HANDS ON
