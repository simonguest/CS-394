**Objective:** Build a Gradio chat interface (in a separate Colab notebook) that helps users plan trips.

**Requirements:**

- Gradio chat interface with streaming responses
- System prompt that defines the AI as a travel planning expert
- Use at least 2 different system prompts (short and long) and share observations
- Use at least 2 different models via OpenRouter as a dropdown in Gradio. Try to pick a large (foundational model) and a much smaller open source model to compare the differences.

**Deliverable: A Colab/Jupyter notebook with:**

- Code cells with your implementation
- Uses OPENROUTER_API_KEY for the API token (do not include your API key in your notebook!)
- Markdown cells explaining what the notebook does and any observations

** Stretch Goal (Non-graded)**
- After the conversation, a "Generate Itinerary" button that uses structured outputs to create a formatted itinerary
- Structured output schema: Trip with fields like destination, duration_days, activities (list), budget_level, daily_schedule (list of day objects)
