## Recap

- Used generated synthetic data to fine-tune a 1B parameter model
- Used W&B (Weights and Biases) to observe parameters during the training run
- Post-training, used W&B to use cosine similarity and LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate the accuracy of our trained model
- Trained smaller models (270M parameters) and compared the results
- Understood and created a model card, uploaded the model to Hugging Face and shared

## Lesson Objectives

- Discuss ethical, IP, and safety concerns for Generative AI
- Use an evidence-based approach to explore ethical implications and potential mitigations
- Use an evidence-based approach to explore IP implications and potential mitigations
- Use an evidence-based approach to explore safety implications and potential mitigations
- Research a theme (or media claim) and author a paper confirming or challenging it
